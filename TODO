    [x] to get values, don't interrogate the database, just do a AXFR
        using dig. this will let you know what is current and what needs
        to be comitted. 
        [x] A GET will only get anything comitted.

[x] cli v1.8

    [x] un hardcode 'dig' (use 'dig' not '/usr/bin/dig')

    [x] conf server <ip> <password>
        [x] if not specified, blank is ok
            [x] need to undef the password...
        [x] still use 'conf server pass <passwd> to
            explicitly set the password
        When connected to a DNS One, and then you disconnect, and then connect
        to a non-DNS One, the ibcli craps out as it can't connect. When
        you disc from one DNS One, and connect to another with a
        different scripting password, you also have issues.

            );

            if you don't want to define remote id, then is should be:
            ib_modify_global_dhcp_options(
              "dhcp_class",  "remote_class3", "true", "ccc", "false"
            );

    [-] push all the GOOD commands into a stack
        [-] create a -q (queue) option that just adds to the stack
            USE this for the shell based CLI version
            [-] stack to a $HOME/.ibcli_stack
                [-] prepend the IP address of the server for sanity
                [-] if there is stack, show a '*'
            [-] changing servers will dump the stack
        [-] 'commit' processes the stack (and dumps it)
