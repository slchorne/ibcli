## Introduction

The Ibcli is a simple command line tool that lets you do some (mostly)
powerful things.  It leverages the Infoblox api but provides a wrapper to
the more complex (and detailed) API calls that uses more simple command
line type calls.

It also lets you create batch scripts that can configure an Infoblox SDB
without actually writing any perl.

The full documentation is perldoc in the code itself, also
[available here](http://slchorne.github.com/ibcli/user_guide_ibcli.html)

### Forking

The last significant update to ibcli was nearly a year ago, So I'm
declaring this thing "As stable as it will ever be" and releasing it
into the wild. Perhaps there are folks out there who have their own
fixes, or just patches they want to send me. Fork, pull request, patch etc
